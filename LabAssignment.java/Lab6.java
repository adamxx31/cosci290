//import Scanner for usage
import.java.util.Scanner;
public class Lab6{

  //entry point of app
  public static void main(String[] args){
    
    //instantiate the Scanner object for usage, call it input
    Scanner Input = new Scanner(System.in);
      
    //declare a variable that is type int and call this variable num
    int num = ();
    
    //declare a variable that is type int and call this variable sum

    int sum = ();
    //prompt the user with this message "Please enter in a whole number."

      System.out.println("Please enter in a whole numnber");
    /*
      using Scanner, which is called input, get the int from user input, 
      then assign it to the num variable
    */

    
    //add num to 5 and assign this to sum
     
    
    //prompt the user with the sum
    System.out.println("The sum of " + num + " and 5 is " + sum);
